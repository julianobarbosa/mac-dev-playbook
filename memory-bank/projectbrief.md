# Mac Development Ansible Playbook Project Brief

## Core Requirements

1. Automate macOS development environment setup using Ansible
2. Support both local and remote Mac configuration
3. Maintain flexibility through customizable configuration
4. Support incremental installation through tagged tasks
5. Provide comprehensive documentation for manual steps

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Automate the installation and configuration of development software on macOS

2. **Specific Objectives**:
   - Install essential development tools and applications
   - Configure system preferences for optimal development
   - Support custom package selection through configuration
   - Enable remote Mac management
   - Maintain idempotent operations
   - Document any manual steps required

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **Software Installation**
   - Command line tools and utilities
   - Development applications via Homebrew Cask
   - App Store applications via mas
   - Programming language environments
   - Development tools and IDEs

2. **Configuration**
   - System preferences
   - Development environment setup
   - Dock configuration
   - User dotfiles management

3. **Documentation**
   - Installation instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Manual setup steps
   - Testing procedures

### Out of Scope

1. Non-development related software and settings
2. Personal data migration
3. System backup and restore
4. Hardware-specific configurations

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully installs and configures all specified development tools
2. Supports customization through config.yml
3. Works on both local and remote Macs
4. Maintains idempotency (can be run multiple times safely)
5. Clearly documents any manual steps required
6. Passes continuous testing on GitHub Actions

## Constraints

1. Some macOS aspects require manual configuration
2. Certain App Store apps require manual sign-in
3. Must maintain compatibility with different macOS versions
4. Some applications may require manual installation (e.g., Adobe Creative Cloud)

## Technical Stack

1. **Core Technologies**
   - Ansible for automation
   - Homebrew for package management
   - mas for App Store integration
   - Shell scripting for system configuration

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - GitHub Actions for CI
   - macOS test environments (UTM, Tart)
